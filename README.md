### The Vision
To create a non-proprietary healthcare professional course to teach Best Practice in Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy.

### How can you help?
All open source projects begins with people like you. Open source is the belief that if we collaborate we can together gift our knowledge and technology to the world for the benefit of humanity.

_________________
## Introduction
This repository consists of a series of recommended books, articles, interviews, and videos that together cover the majority of what is needed to become a Psychedelic-Assisted Therapist knowledge. While this curriculum cannot currently replace certifications it is meant to be the basis by which others create their own courses from.

For those of you interested in pursuing the path of providing psychedelic-assisted therapy, this may still be useful to help complement your education and enable you to start learning now. This may be especially useful if you are on a waiting list for an industry certification training course but do not want to wait to start your education, or if you are self-led and learn very well outside of a group or classroom environment.

The curriculum includes all required and recommended reading material posted by the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies and Research Certificate program, as well as many other videos, articles, and recommended literature sources that can be found in the public domain. We lean heavily on suggestions from leaders in the field, including but not limited to the [Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)](https://maps.org/), [CIIS](https://www.ciis.edu/research-centers/center-for-psychedelic-therapies-and-research), [Integrative Psychiatry Institute (IPI)](https://psychiatryinstitute.com/ipi-year-long-psychedelic-assisted-therapy-training/), and others.

If you have arrived at this page as a casual observer of this emerging field, you are encouraged to read this article from the Harvard Medical School as a short primer, [Back to the Future: Psychedelic drugs in psychiatry](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/back-to-the-future-psychedelic-drugs-in-psychiatry-202106222508).

## Contributing
As identified by a [team of psychedelic researchers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.586682/full), "enhanced online learning and establishing pathways for clinical training are identified as critical points for quality assurance. This will require close public, academic and industry collaboration.” OSPAT is a great format for this to occur.

With OSPAT being an open-source repository, anyone can contribute to the OSPAT curriculum. We welcome all contributors! Especially clinicians, researchers, or other professionals with experience in the psychedelic therapy space. If you would like to help develop the curriculum, [click here to learn how](https://github.com/unshakenme/OSPAP/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Recommended Prerequisite Skills and Experience
If you are interested in the psychedelic-assisted therapy space or seeking training, be sure to read the Psychedelic.Support article, [How to Become a Psychedelic Therapist](https://psychedelic.support/resources/training-psychedelic-therapist/).

Below are the minimum prerequisites that will give you a solid foundation before pursuing psychedelic-assisted therapy training or the OSPAT curriculum:
1. Licensed professional with demonstrated competency in clinical psychotherapy (LPC, LMFT, LCSW, Clinical Psychologists, Counseling PhD and PsyD, Psychiatrists, Pharmacists, Psychiatric Nurses, MDiv., MD, and BCC-Board Certified Chaplains, etc.)
2. Training in IFS, EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, MBSR/MBCT, Yoga Nidra, or other specialized therapies. 
3. Personal experience with psychedelic-assisted therapy.


## Structure
The curriculum is split into 2 parts, the core requirements and several elective options. The core requirements aim to cover the basic knowledge every provider of psychedelic-assisted therapy should be familiar with. This foundation will allow students to more easily absorb the information contained in the elective options.

Each section of the elective options has a minimum completion requirement.

For each textbook or video, a link is provided if the content is available on the open domain. The only content we will include that must be purchased will be books, and we will aim to include multiple sourcing links when available.

We will also include ISBN and PubMedID when available.

You are encouraged to check your local library for any books listed in the curriculum!
